Hi, I'm Radek, a 25 years young software engineer based in London.

I got my formal education in CS at the
[Brno University of Technology](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/.en)
(graduated in 2013). However, my passion for computer programming is much
older than that. It all started more than a decate ago with small adventures
in Delphi and HTML. A lot has changed since I was 12, although my interest
in software engineering only grew stronger.

Starting early in 2012 until late 2013, I had the privilege to be a part of
**Red Hat**. I worked there as a developer of the
[LNST framework](http://www.lnst-project.org) within the kernel-qe team.
In mid-2012, I started working on a project within the ext4 file system with
Lukas Czerner. My goal was to optimize the way it stores directories on disk.

There are also several open projects I developed on my own. The latest addition
being fsgraph, a tool for file systems benchmarking and analysis. The
languages I use the most are C, C++, Python, Ruby, and Bash.

After almost two years with Red Hat, I made the decision to move to London
and enter the world of startups. In October 2013 I joined **Kano** -- a company
developing open-source based computer kits for everyone. My role here is
a software engineer and with a team of 12 amazing people, we're on a mission
to make learning computer programming fun and accessible to anyone.

Besides computers, I am an avid reader, a guitar player (more than 7 years),
and regular runner. I enjoy longboarding, snowboarding, and many other sports
that require using a board (not waterboarding though).
