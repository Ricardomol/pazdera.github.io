Hi, I'm Radek.

I'm a software engineer based in London.

I like making new things, learning new things and writing about both. For the
last 14 years, I've been designing and writing computer programs. *I know,
I can't believe it's been so long either.* A lot has changed since I was 12,
but my interest in software only grew stronger.

Over the years, I got to work with many different technologies including
Ruby, Python, C, Bash, JS, CoffeeScript, NodeJS and many others.
I like working with open source projects and there are
[several](http://radek.io/work) that I developed and maintain on my own.

Starting early in 2012, I joined Red Hat's kernel-qe team to work on the
[LNST project](http://www.lnst-project.org), a tool for making automated
and portable network tests (focused on the networking stack in Linux).

In October 2013, I moved to London to join [Kano](http://kano.me) and help
building [Kano OS](http://developers.kano.me/), an intuitive, beginner-friendly
distribution of Linux for the Raspberry Pi. I've been involved in many
projects at Kano, including our
[package repository manager](http://radek.io/2014/05/12/dr/),
the [system on-boarding](https://youtu.be/zzD9LVA1NNE) and
[updater](https://github.com/KanoComputing/kano-updater/). I also made [this
animation](http://developers.kano.me/matrix.html).
