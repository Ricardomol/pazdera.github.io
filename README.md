# Linuxwell

These are the sources of the [Linuxwell website](http://linuxwell.com). The
theme is based on Rosario's port of the Ghost default Casper theme. I added
some minor things to it and of course my content.

The original Kasper Jekyll theme is available
[here](https://github.com/rosario/kasper).
