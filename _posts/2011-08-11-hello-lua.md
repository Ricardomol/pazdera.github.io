Back in the day, when I used to play [World of Warcraft](http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/)
(shame on me), I noticed they use something called [Lua](http://www.lua.org/)
to let players extend their user interface with various addons and tweaks. It
worked very good. There are literally thousands of available
[addons](http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/default.aspx) for World of
Warcraft. I quit the game about 2 years ago and I never got to look further
into Lua, until now.

As it turns out, Lua is quite popular among game developers as an extension
scripting language due to it's C API. Common practice is to implement the
engine and some basic game features in C++ and then script all the content in
lua. That way it's easier to tweak the game, because it's not hard-coded and
compiled. As the official website says:

Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is
dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual
machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage
collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid
prototyping.

Sounds pretty neat. And on top of that, lua is open-source. It's distributed
under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)!
