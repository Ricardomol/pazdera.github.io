Just yesterday, after a long time of evaluating all pro's and con's, I finally
decided to install Fedora 15 on my desktop machine.

I've been using Debian-based distros since high school and I've gotten used to
it pretty hard over the years. I started with Ubuntu 7.04, then switched to
Kubuntu to enjoy some KDE. Then by the time I went to college I was using
Debian, which made me happy for some time. After Debian I switched back to
Ubuntu.

Now, why did I decide for **Fedora**? Well, the Ubuntu on my machine was
quite outdated and the new 11.04 comes with Unity and software centers.
Well, I just wanted to try something different. On top of that, Fedora 15
comes with the new **Gnome 3**!

Now, after the install and some babysteps with Fedora, I have to say it's
pretty amazing. The Gnome 3 environment is **FAR** from perfect, but it's
usable. In my opinion it's way better than the KDE4. It takes some getting
used to, but not that much actually. I was pretty bummed out without a task
bar, the top menu, but I see, that I don't need those anymore :-).
