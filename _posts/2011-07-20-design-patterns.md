Another thing I've been avoiding for a long time is **design patterns** and
their use in software development. Now it's time to learn to use all those
things! What I intend to do is go through all of them and write an example
implementation of each in **C++** and **Python**. You'll find links to
respective posts here later on as I add them.

> In software engineering, a **design pattern** is a general repeatable
solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design
pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code.
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used
in many different situations.

Patterns are often divided into three categories.

## [Creational Design Patterns](http://sourcemaking.com/creational_patterns)

Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object
creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the
situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems
or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this
problem by somehow controlling this object creation. Creational design
patterns are further categorized into Object-creational patterns and
Class-creational patterns. Where, Object-creational patterns deal with
Object creation and Class-creational deal with Class-instantiation.

## [Structural Design Patterns](http://sourcemaking.com/structural_patterns)

Structural Design Patterns are Design Patterns that ease the design by
identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

## [Behavioral Design Patterns](http://sourcemaking.com/behavioral_patterns)

Behavioral Design Patterns are design patterns that identify common
communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing
so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
