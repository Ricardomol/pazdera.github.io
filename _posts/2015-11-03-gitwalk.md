Complex systems are usually made up of many components that span at least a few
code repositories. And while this is a very good thing, it adds a few extra
steps to your workflow. Having to keep several repositories up to date and on
the right branches can become a little cumbersome when you need to quickly
search for something or automate a minor change across the whole system. This
is when [gitwalk](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk) comes in.

**gitwalk** lets you manipulate multiple repositories at once. It’s the
man-in-the-middle that abstracts away the repetitive work and lets you focus on
what needs to be done. You select a group of repos using a simple **expression**
and provide an **operation** to be completed for each one. This may be searching
through files or the commit history, running tests and linters or even editing
and pushing changes back upstream — whatever you can think of. And it
integrates with [GitHub](https://github.com).

I've been working on gitwalk in my spare time over the past few months and
today, I'm releasing it as open source.

# Where to get it?

It's made in [CoffeeScript](coffeescript.org) and runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
You can use `npm` to install it like any other Node package:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g gitwalk
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure to include the `-g` option to get the CLI command in your system
`$PATH`. But if you'd like to use the library directly, that's possible too.
Check out the [JavaScript
API](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#javascript-api).

## How it works?

The `gitwalk` command takes of arguments: one or more **expressions** and a
**processor**. It will evaluate the expressions into a list of repositories and
run the processor on each one. This is how it might look:

{% highlight bash %}
gitwalk "github:pazdera/@(tco|scriptster)" command ls -l ./lib
{% endhighlight %}

When invoked like this, it would take the [tco](https://github.com/pazdera/tco)
an [scripster](https://github.com/pazdera/scriptster) repos from my [GitHub
account](https://github.com/pazdera?tab=repositories), clone them into a local
cache and run the `ls` command on each one. Here’s the result of running that
on my system:

{% include figure.html img="gitwalk/gitwalk-example.png" alt="gitwalk: An example" width="90%" caption='Listing files in two repositories at the same time.' %}

Gitwalk comes with a few expression resolvers and processors built-in, which
are described below. However, it’s been designed to be extended with new ones
that you can tailor to your needs.

If pushing to your repositories requires authentication (and it probably does),
gitwalk can deal with both **ssh** or **http** auth and even access your private
repositories on GitHub (if you give it your auth token). Learn how to configure
all of that in the [documentation](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#features).

## Expressions

Expressions say which repositories will be processed. You can provide one ore
more of them and gitwalk will merge the results. Additionally an expression can
be marked _negative_ to exclude previously matched entires. Check out the
following examples:

{% highlight bash %}
# Matches all branches of the npm repo on GitHub.
$ gitwalk 'github:npm/npm:*' ...

# Matches all the git repositories in my home dir.
$ gitwalk '~/**/*' ...

# Use ^ to exclude previously matched repositories.
# Matches all my repos on GitHub _except_ of scriptster.
$ gitwalk 'github:pazdera/*' '^github:pazdera/scriptster' ...

# URLs work too.
$ gitwalk 'https://github.com/pazdera/tco.git:*' ...

# You can predefine custom groups of repositories.
# Check out the _Groups_ resolver below.
$ gitwalk 'group:all-js' 'group:all-ruby' ...
{% endhighlight %}

If you’d like to test what each of these expressions match without doing
anything, try them with the `--dry-run` option:

{% include figure.html img="gitwalk/gitwalk-dry-run.png" alt="gitwalk: An example" width="90%" caption='<strong>Dry run</strong>: Printing all matches.' %}

## Processors

A processor is an action that runs for each matched repository and branch and
does something. This includes things like searching, linting, testing, editing
and committing. As simple or as complex as you need it to be. Gitwalk will
checkout the working tree and point the script’s `$PWD` to it.

There are a few [predefined processors](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#processors) that you can use to perform some basic
tasks on the repositories, but the true power lies in making your own (which is
pretty simple to do). Here are a few examples of the default ones:

{% highlight bash %}
# Search for unfinished work in all JavaScript files
$ gitwalk ... grep '(TODO|FIXME)' '**/*.js'

# List all files in the repository
$ gitwalk ... command 'tree .'

# Another way to search the files
$ gitwalk ... command 'git grep "(TODO|FIXME)"'

# Replace the year in all Ruby files
$ gitwalk ... files '**/*.rb' 'sed -i s/2015/2016/g #{file}'

# Simple commit message profanity detector
$ gitwalk ... commits 'grep "(f.ck|sh.t|b.llocks)" <<<"#{message}"'
{% endhighlight %}

The [grep](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#grep) processor lets you search
the codebase with regular expressions, not unlike Unix grep. The
[command](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#command) one lets you run an
arbitrary shell command for each repository which can be a custom script.
[Commits](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#commits) and
[files](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#files) allow you to iterate over all
the commits and files in the repository respectively and run a custom command
for each one.

The `#{hashCurlyBraced}` templates will be expanded into values before the
command is executed. Each command exports different set of variables; check
out the [docs](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk#grep) to find out more.

## JavaScript API

If you prefer doing your scripting using Node instead, you can call gitwalk
directly from JS there and use exactly the same functionality from there as
well:

{% highlight bash %}
var gitwalk = require('gitwalk');

gitwalk('github:pazdera/\*', gitwalk.proc.grep(/TODO/, '*.js'), function (err) {
    if (err) {
        console.log 'gitwalk failed (' + err + ')';
    }
});
{% endhighlight %}

##  Summary

Making changes across several parts of a complex system can be tricky and
time-consuming. Having a solid test coverage is essential to make sure
everything works when you’re done and a set of good tools will help you get
it done quicker.

Gitwalk is available right now on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitwalk)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/pazdera/gitwalk), licensed under the MIT
licence. I hope you find it useful!
