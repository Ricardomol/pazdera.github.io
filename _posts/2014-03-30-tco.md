Today, I pushed out the first release of the
[tco gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/tco). The goal of this project is to make
working with the **t**erminal **co**lours as simple as possible; hence the name
**tco**. The main feature of this tool is in the way it works with colours.
Instead of an oddly organised sequence of colour codes, **tco** uses simple
**RGB**. It provides a library for your Ruby gems and apps, and also a
standalone command-line tool that you can use anywhere else.

If you've ever worked with the **extended colour palette** in the terminal, you
probably know that it's not really easy to find the colour you want. The
palette consists of 256 colours that are evenly sampled through the RGB space.
As opposed to the **ANSI palette**, the colours tend to be the same across
different terminals. They are assigned linearly to a set of escape sequences
that are used to apply the colours. And that is the problem; searching
through the palette is very unintuitive.

On the other hand, selecting a RGB colour using your favourite
[colour picker](http://www.colourpicker.com/) is a nice, buttery piece of cake
with a bit of cream on top. That is everything you need to do; pass the value
to `tco` and it will sort out all the boring bits for you. Using the
RGB value, the library will find the **perceptually closest** option that is
displayable in your terminal and decorate the string with the appropriate
escape sequences, letting you focus on more interesting things in life instead.

## How does it work then?

Let me start with explaining the `tco` command-line tool first. Among all
the parameters it accepts, there are four essential ones that control directly
how the output will look like. That includes setting the **foreground** `-f`
and **background** `-b` colours, and also the **bold** `-B` and **underline**
`-u` flags. The actual input can be passed either as an argument or piped to
stdin. See the following examples:

    <img src="/assets/images/posts/tco-cli.png" alt="Tco in the terminal">
    <figcaption>Figure 3: Ways of using tco in the terminal</figcaption>
</figure>

In most cases, you will probably use several colours and settings over and over
again. To help you with that, tco comes with configurable **colour names** and
**style definitions**. You can set them either system-wide in `/etc/tco.conf`
or just for a single user in the `~/.tco.conf` file (for more information on
its format, see the example on
[Github](https://github.com/pazdera/tco/blob/master/tco.conf-example)). Once
you've configured some, you can access them through the `-s` option.

</figure>

Fairly often, you might want to decorate different parts of a string with
different colours. Instead of having to split the string and print it in parts,
you can use a simple **template syntax** to indicate how should each of the
parts be decorated. These templates are enclosed in double curly brackets
`{% raw %}{{ }}{% endraw %}`. The first part of a template is the colour
definition `fg:bg:ub`, followed by a space and the string to be decorated.
You can even nest them; see the few examples bellow:

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/tco-templates.png" alt="Using templates">
    <figcaption>Figure 5: Several examples of different templates</figcaption>
</figure>

There are a few more options available for different things; get the full
up-to-date list by passing `-h` to the program.

## Using the Ruby library

`tco` is a gem, so you can use the same functionality in your own Ruby apps and
scripts too. The interface is pretty simple with just a few methods that cover
all the functionality. For convenience, there is a `String` extension that
makes these functions accessible directly from all string objects.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'tco'

puts "Red font on grey background".fg("#ff0000").bg("#bebebe")
puts "Bold and underlined".bold.underline

{% raw %}
puts "{{#000:#ff0000 R}}{{#000:#00ff00 G}}{{#000:#0000ff B}}".decorate
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Most applications are likely to use a fixed palette of colours only.
Therfore, it is really simple to reconfigure the library to match the
needs of your program. You can define your own colour names and styles to which
you can refer to later on. These settings will be applied on top of the
user and system configurations, but they won't be saved when you application
terminates. The following example shows exactly how to do it:

{% highlight ruby %}
require "tco"

conf = Tco.config
conf.names["purple"] = "#622e90"
conf.names["dark-blue"] = "#2d3091"
conf.names["blue"] = "#00aaea"
conf.names["green"] = "#02a552"
conf.names["yellow"] = "#fdea22"
conf.names["orange"] = "#f37f5a"
conf.names["red"] = "#eb443b"
Tco.reconfigure conf

rainbow = ["purple", "dark-blue", "blue", "green", "yellow", "orange", "red"]
10.times do
  rainbow.each { |colour| print "    ".bg colour }
  puts
end
{% endhighlight %}

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/tco-rainbow.png" alt="Drawing a rainbow">

</figure>

If you would like to get really crazy, you can even render a very low
resolution images inside the terminal. You'll need to print roughly 2 spaces
for each pixel (it's not perfect, but close enough). The following example
reads a PNG picture of the Tux using the `rmagick` gem and displays it in the
terminal.

{% highlight ruby %}
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require "tco"
require "rmagick"

Magick::Image.read("tux.png")[0].each_pixel do |pixel, col, row|
  c = [pixel.red, pixel.green, pixel.blue].map { |v| 255*(v/65535.0) }
  print "  ".bg c
  puts if col >= 53
end
{% endhighlight %}

</figure>

## Summary

And that's it! It's quite a simple gem, but it can help you make your console
apps more lively and their output much easier to navigate with barely any
additional effort. It's available right now on
[RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/gems/tco), the sources are hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pazdera/tco), licensed under MIT.
