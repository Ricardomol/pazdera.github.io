What is **solid** object-oriented design? Like, strong, steady, you know or
not a liquid or something? Well, who knows? Unless it's written in
**CAPITALS**! In that case it's a acronym introduced by **Robert C. Martin** in
the early 2000s which stands for five basic principles of object-oriented
programming and design. What are these principles?

- **SRP** -- [Single responsibility
principle](http://linuxwell.com/2011/08/08/single-responsibility-principle/
"Single Responsibility Principle")
- **OCP** -- [ Open/Closed
principle](http://linuxwell.com/2011/08/04/openclosed-principle-in-software-design/
"Open/Closed Principle in Software Design")
- **LSP** -- [Liskov substitution
principle](http://linuxwell.com/2011/08/09/liskov-substitution-principle/
"Liskov Substitution Principle")
- **ISP** -- [Interface segregation
principle](http://linuxwell.com/2011/08/12/interface-segregation-principle-in-software-design/
"Interface Segregation Principle in Software Design")
- **DIP** -- [Dependency inversion
principle](http://linuxwell.com/2011/08/10/dependency-inversion-principle/
"Dependency Inversion Principle")

The principles (or guidelines), when applied together intend to make it more
likely, that a programmer will create a system, that is easy to maintain and
extend over time. These guidelines are here simply to make our lives a little
easier. They're certainly not to be followed religiously (including laying a
fierce wrath upon anyone who dares to break them). If you find out, that your
design abides them, good for you! If it doesn't and you know the reason why,
it's no problem either :-).

I find them very helpful, especially when it comes to evaluating my work and
that's why I decided to take a break from design patterns for a while and go
through the** SOLID** set of principles first.
