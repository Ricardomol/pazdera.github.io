The start of a new year is a milestone that makes many of us stop and look
forward. What 2016 has in store for us? The next 12 months give us an
opportunity to grow and empty page to fill.

When planning ahead, we need to look back and reflect. What worked well and
what didn't? It'd foolish to repeat the same mistakes. This post looks at how
things went for this blog in 2015.

## Some numbers

Over the past 12 months, I posted 28 new articles. Four went out in the
first half of 2015, and 24 in the second. The website amassed `127,848` hits,
`109,572` of which came in the second part of the year, after I started
publishing every week.

I wrote 28,262 words in total, about the same number of words that make up
George Orwell's [Animal Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm). The
average post was then `1009.35` words long.

I wrote a post every weekend in the second half of 2015 except of one. The
struggle to get the next post out was real sometimes, but that's a part of it,
isn’t it?

## The popular ones

I got a few really good hits this year. The most popular saw as much visits as
the whole website over the whole previous year. Here’s the TOP 3 for 2015:

1. [httpie: A CLI http client that will make you
smile](http://radek.io/2015/10/20/httpie/) (32,416)
2. [Printing images in the terminal with 9 lines of
Ruby](http://radek.io/2015/06/29/catpix/) (11,533)
3. [Bringing the best of Bash scripting to
Ruby](http://radek.io/2015/07/13/ruby-scripting/) (7,514)

These three and various other posts were featured in the [Hacker
Newsletter](http://www.hackernewsletter.com/), [Ruby](http://rubyweekly.com/)
and [Node](http://nodeweekly.com/) Weekly and [Ruby5
podcast](https://ruby5.codeschool.com/). The post about httpie made it to the
front page of [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com) for a bit.

To my sincere astonishment, [The Next
Web](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/06/29/never-gonna-give-you-up-never-gonna-let-you-down-never-gonna-turn-around-and-desert-you/#gref)
featured my [catpix gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/catpix/) on its front page:

{% include figure.html img="2015-review/tnw.png" alt="radek.io on The Next Web" width="90%" caption='Not exactly what I tried to say' %}

Considering that the former got three times the number of hits, making it on
Hacker News seems to work better than being picked up by _real press_.

A honourable mention goes to

* [Private, protected and public in
Python](http://radek.io/2011/07/21/private-protected-and-public-in-python/)
(11,826)
* [Static variables and methods in
Python](http://radek.io/2011/07/21/static-variables-and-methods-in-python/)
(8,079)
* [The Magical container\_of()
Macro](http://radek.io/2012/11/10/magical-container_of-macro/) (5,059).

These three articles remain amongst the most visited posts on the site.

## The mistakes

Every post I put out with the same level of enthusiasm for the topic and hope
that people will find it useful. Each one of them takes roughly the same effort
to write and edit. And few of them fall completely flat. Here are the TOP 3
disasters of 2015:

1. [docopt: A brief introduction](http://radek.io/2015/01/19/docopt/) (23)
2. [My notes from LNUG November
2015](http://radek.io/2015/11/29/lnug-november-2015/) (60)
3. [Should innovation be driven by experiments or
experience?](http://radek.io/2015/08/10/experience-vs-experiment-driven-innovation/)
(102)

Docopt went out after a long period of inactivity, so that isn't that
surprising. LNUG is only relevant to a few hundred people in London. But I
genuinely thought the third one would be interesting. Well, that's awkward.

## Happy New Year

Thank you for reading my posts and supporting what I do. You guys make it fun!

In 2016, I hope to bring you as much useful content about programming and open
source as I possibly can. If you have anything that you'd like me to write
about, [shoot me an email](me@radek.io) or tweet at
[@radekpazdera](https://twitter.com/radekpazdera).

Have an awesome 2016!
