[Github](https://github.com) -- the most popular hosting service for open
source projects was founded seven years ago. It brought the ideas of free
software to a much broader audience, particularly of younger programmers and
undoubtedly made a mark on the way we see open source today.

But it's not the only thing that changed. Open source is now _the way_ software
is done. [Over 70% of companies](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/future-of-open-source)
run on open source and giants like Facebook, Twitter or even Microsoft release
new projects in dozens, unleashing an entirely new set of challenges for the
open source world. What will the next seven years look like for programmers?

## Code and community

Code is obviously an important part of every open source software project.
Particularly in the beginning, it's the reason why a group of people gets
together to start a community.

Programmers are passionate about their work which makes code a source of
numerous rows and squabbles that can send
[shockwaves](http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/81262.html) through communities
of thousands. As the father of the Linux Kernel noted himself:

> Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
> â€”Linus Torvalds ([LKML](https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132 "Linus Torvalds's famous quote"))

But it's the **community** that makes open source great. Without it, the code
is just code. When no one cares, does it really matter whether it's open source
or not?

We release new open source projects hoping that people will find them useful and
maybe jump in and start making them with us. But if the code is the only thing
you release, chances are that not many of them will show up.

Having a good documentation ready, quick guides written up, being polite and
respond to questions in timely manner are a few things that can help you build
and maintain a healthy community around your project. These things used to be
the difference between _good_ and _bad_ open source projects. But in the
future, they will make the difference between the successful ones and the ones
that nobody notices.

Needless to say, managing a community isn't easy and it might not be what a
programmer expects to be doing when releasing code to the public. Whatever
the popularity of your project, if your community is unwelcoming or poorly
managed, people will just move somewhere else.

Open source software is more of a social enterprise that it seems.

## From openness to accessibility

As the opening paragraph hints, companies don't hold back when releasing their
projects to the public. With large players like
[Facebook](https://github.com/facebook) (137),
[Twitter](https://github.com/twitter) (130) or even
[Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) (206) leading the pack with hundreds
of public repositories, the competition for the attention of developers is
fierce.

Just a few weeks ago, IBM
[announced](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/business/ibm-launches-open-source-platform-to-release-50-projects-to-the-community)
that it will be dropping off 50 projects out in the open. With that strategy,
it's safe to say that they won't see a heaving rabble of developers, hitting
their servers with their spears sharpened and keyboards at the ready to
contribute.

The work only begins when you make your project open and it will most certainly
take time before IBM's truckload of stuff builds a following; if at all.

The open source world is moving on to solving the lack of **accessibility**
instead of the lack of **openness**. Is your project really open source when
you're the only one in the world that can understand it?

## Open source careers

Many pieces were written on the subject of [technical
interviews](http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/03/11/technical-recruiting-broken-4-ways-hire-better/)
[being broken](http://erniemiller.org/2013/09/19/interviews-are-broken/). Open
source is one way to solve this issue may be solved over the next few years.

Companies such as [Workshape](https://www.workshape.io/) already use the
applicants's Github profiles and match them with suitable employers. There's no
reason why this couldn't go even further to evaluating someone's abilities
based on the work they did within the open source community.

Seeing a person at work on an open source project gives you a much better idea
of how good they are than having them reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard.

On the other side, many engineers will recognize the value of working in the
open. Contributing to open source projects gives you an opportunity
to work outside your team, break the stereotype and learn from great programmers
you would have otherwise never met.

As not everyone has the time or wants to hack on projects in their spare time,
being able to build a portfolio of open source contributions while on the job
might soon become a requirement of jobseekers in the industry.

## Summary

The surge in popularity of open source software amongst both companies and
individuals in the past few years has brought many changes to the way we see
the idea of open source. But it would be foolish to think that the journey is
over.

Never before have programmers enjoyed so much power over software vendors and
had so much resources freely available to them. But the steep rise in quantity
makes it more difficult to succeed when releasing new projects and it will get
even tougher in the future, possibly increasing the gap between individual and
company backed projects that can actively market them.
