I got a little sick of the [Titan](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/titan)
theme and while I was doing some changes to the site, I decided to let it go in
favor of [Skeptical](http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/skeptical/). I don't
have everything figured out just yet as you can see, but I'm getting to it!
Here is the old version of **Linuxwell**:

[ ![Old Linuxwell](/assets/images/posts/initial_theme.jpg
"Old Linuxwell") ](/assets/images/posts/initial_theme.jpg)

I think it's clearly an improvement over the old one. The only thing that bugs
me is the width of the main column. It could be a little bigger ...

## License

I also added a license information to the footer at the bottom of the page.
All content on this site is licensed under [Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported
License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) and the source
codes go under GNU [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). The licenses
may come off a little scary (especially the first one), but they are (in my
opinion) very permissive and allow you to use all of my work.
