It’s been almost a year since my last post on this website. That is quite sad.
There were so many things happening over the course of the past year which
left me with absolutely no energy left to work on new content to be published
here. So much has changed, I learned a lot from it, and now, I think, is the
perfect time to carry on and start writing again.

I started of this year by moving the site away from the original hosting at
[Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) to
[Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). I did that, because I felt I hadn't
had enough control over the content. I mean, Wordpress certainly offers many
options in this respect, but, personally, I’m not willing to pay $125 for the
ability to change font colour and remove the add, nor am I willing to buy a
proprietary theme.

On the other hand, I really like what [Github](http://github.com) is doing
with their Pages hosting. It is really straight-forward to maintain and
publish your site with git. This has been really important for me, as there
are more than 60 different articles on this page and I would like to keep
adding new ones. I also like the way Jekyll allows you to work.

    </a>

That said, it took me quite a while to set everything up and migrate all the
content from one system to another without it suffering from any major loses.
I spend the holidays and the first part of January doing that. I considered a
number of themes for Jekyll including
[So Simple](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/),
[HPSTR](http://mademistakes.com/articles/hpstr-jekyll-theme/), and
[Balzac](http://jekyll.gtat.me/about/). In the end, I found a port of
Ghost’s [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) made by
[Rosario Rascuna](http://rosario.io) and used that one. However, I customised
it quite a bit.

The most prominent change that’s been added are the full-screen cover photos
that are now a part of each post. I got into photography quite a bit lately,
which is the main reason behind using the [Medium](http://medium.com) inspired
covers. It means I can actually use some of my pictures for something, instead
of just keeping them on my hard drive.

I don’t want to become overambitious with the posting schedule, so I’ll start
slowly by adding a post roughly each two weeks and we’ll see how it goes :-).
Happy 2014!
