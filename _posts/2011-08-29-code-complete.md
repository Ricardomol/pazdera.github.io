I got a copy of this awesome book today and I'm so excited, I have to write a
post about it :-)!

> All right, mate, you got yourself a book, carry on.

But it's in English! I read this holy bible of programming already. But it was
only the crappy Czech translation, which is not only a lot worse, it's actually
more expensive than the original version.

The only thing that sucks about this book is, that it's a paperback. Why the
hell does anyone ship a thousand-page book in paperback version only? The
explanation is very simple. In fact, it's written right on the cover. Let's see
if you can figure it out! Here's a couple of pictures:

You got it! **Microsoft Press**. Who else could possibly screw up this
otherwise perfect piece of literature? Even the Czech version comes in
hardcover edition. Yeah, I'm kind of a Microsoft hater. Other than that the
book is just amazing. I recommend it to everyone who is serious about software
development.
