Releasing your own software packages for Debian-based distributions is really
not easy. Apart from at least basic knowledge of the packaging conventions,
you have to be familiar with several different tools and know how they work
together. At [Kano](http://kano.me/), we push new code up to several times
a day, so we made a tool to minimise the packaging overhead in our development
cycle. It's called **dr** and we open-sourced it just last week.

**dr** (short for *debian repository*) automates many of the tasks you would
need to do to manage a small repo for any Debian-based distribution. It is
written in **Ruby** and it builds on top of the tools you would normally use
to setup a repo, such as **reprepro**, **debhelper**, **debuild**, or **qemu**.
The important bit is that it hides away the complexity of each tool and let's
you focus exacly on what you need to get done. **dr** is also integrated with
**git**, so you can build your packages directly from your repositories.

## How it works?
**dr** brings all the tools under a uniform interface and lets you very
quickly do various tasks, such as

* setting up a new **repository**,
* building and versioning **packages**,
* making them **available** for users,
* and managing your **releases**.

The following diagram illustrates the big picture of how **dr** operates.
It takes your **source packages** that are managed in **git repositories**,
builds them, and makes them available downstream to the people who use your
repository. You can push your packages into one of 3 suites, **stable**,
**testing**, or **unstable** Your users then can select a level of stability
they prefer by switching between them, just as they can in Debian.

    <img src="/assets/images/posts/dr-basic.png" alt="dr illustrated">

</figure>

One of the most important features is that you can build your packages directly
from your codebase and deploy them with just a **single command**. Your users
will receive the update, while `dr` takes care of the whole process
automatically. That includes pulling the changes, preparing the build
environment, installing the dependencies, building, signing, and pushing the
packages. I'm not making this up :-).

Unfortunatelly, what **dr** cannot do is to provide the Debian packaging
files. You will still need to read through the official
[packaging conventions](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/)
and understand how packages work.

## What can you do with it?
What follows is a quick introductory guide, so you can get an idea how the
**dr** workflow looks like. If you would like to get more detailed information,
please refer to the [project's
wiki](https://github.com/KanoComputing/kano-repository-manager/wiki) on GitHub.
For instance, you can get all the information you'll need to know how to
[install **dr** on your system](https://github.com/KanoComputing/kano-repository-manager/wiki/Installation)
there.

Also, you'll probably notice that the **dr** output is pretty colourful,
sometimes maybe even a bit too much. The process of building packages generates
loads of logs, so we're [colour-coding](https://github.com/pazdera/tco)
different types of information within these logs (such as package names and
versions) to make them easier to navigate.

### Setting up a repository
Before doing anything else, you will need to initialise your repository.
**dr** will guide you through the whole process and do most of the work for
you.

We will need to generate a GPG key in the process, so to make sure there is
enough entropy available on the system, please make sure to run the following
command before running `dr init`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo rngd -r /dev/urandom
{% endhighlight %}

After that, run

{% highlight bash %}
$ dr init <location-of-your-new-repo>
{% endhighlight %}

**dr** will ask you several questions and proceed to preparing the build
environment. The whole process can take up to 30 minutes to complete depending
on your internet connection.

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/dr-init.png" alt="dr init example">
    <figcaption>Initialising a new repository.</figcaption>
</figure>

As there can be several repositories present on a single system (you can run
`dr init` as many times as you like), you need to tell **dr** which one should
be used by default. Otherwise, we would have to type `--repo ~/example`
with every single command. You can find how to configure this on the
[project's wiki](https://github.com/KanoComputing/kano-repository-manager/wiki/Setting-up-a-repository).

### Adding new packages

When adding a new package to the repository, you have two options. You can
either add a prebuilt binary package, or a source package. The former
is useful in case you would like to host a few packages that you manage
in a different way or you didn't build them yourself.

To add a pre-build package run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ dr add --deb path/to/the/package_1.0-35_all.deb
{% endhighlight %}

The full power of `dr` is not unleashed until you add a **source package**.
In that case, **dr** will help you manage building and versioning of the
package. To add a source package, point `dr` to the **git repository** in
which you manage your project's sources. Git is what we use at Kano, and it
is the only supported way at the moment. Use the following command
to add a package:

{% highlight bash %}
$ dr add --git https://github.com/KanoComputing/kano-settings
{% endhighlight %}

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/dr-add.png" alt="dr add example">
    <figcaption>Adding a new package to your repository.</figcaption>
</figure>

**dr** is clever enough to determine all the information it needs about the
package automatically from the sources, so you don't need to do anything
else.

### Building packages
Now when the package has been added, we need to build it. This can be done
very easily using the `dr build <package-name>` command.

<figure class="align-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/dr-build.png" alt="dr build example">
    <figcaption>An example of a package build.</figcaption>
</figure>

**dr** will switch to an isolated build environment, install all the
build dependencies requested by the package and build it. We're using
[foreign chroots](http://www.hellion.org.uk/blog/posts/foreign-chroots-with-schroot-and-qemu/),
so you can even cross-compile packages for different architectures. Depending
on how many dependencies your package has, this process should take around
2 to 5 minutes.

Running a build like this without any other arguments will build the code
from the `master` branch. But most of the development usually happens
outside of `master` in small feature branches, right? Well, in that case
you can add the `-b <branch-name>` option to the `dr build` command and
the package will be built from that branch instead. This can be
particularly useful for testing your changes in **unstable**, before
merging them into `master`.

### Releasing builds

Now that a package has been built, it is time to make it available to
users. This is done by pushing a **build** into a **suite**. And that's
exactly what the following command is for:

{% highlight bash %}
$ dr push kano-settings -v 1.1-1.20140506 -s testing
{% endhighlight %}

Both of the parameters, `-v | --version` and `-s | --suite`, are optional.
If you leave out the first one, `dr` will use the **latest build**
available, and if you don't use the second one, it will push to
**testing** by default.

Now if you're wondering what to do if something goes wrong, there is
a command `dr unpush <package> <suite>` that does exactly the opposite,
i.e., it will remove a package from a suite.

### Inspecting the repo

From maintainers' perspective, it is also important to be able to see what
packages are there in your repo and which versions are in which suite. To do
you can use the `dr list` class of commands. There are few things that can
be listed already (packages, suites, and versions), but many more will
be added in the future as **dr** grows more mature.

    <img src="/assets/images/posts/dr-l-s.png" alt="dr list versions example">

You can find more information about this sub-command on
[our wiki](https://github.com/KanoComputing/kano-repository-manager/wiki/The-dr-workflow#inspection).

## Summary

So this is **dr**. I hope you'll find it just as useful as we do
at [Kano](http://kano.me). We use it on a daily basis to continuously
integrate all the new features and bug fixes into
[Kano OS](http://kano.me/downloads), so we can move at very fast pace.

Please, bear in mind, that it still an early version that was build around
the needs of our team, so it's not feature complete yet. We keep adding new
things as we go, so if you find something is not quite right, please [let me
know](mailto:radek@kano.me). Also, if you like it, you're more than welcome to
[contribute](https://github.com/KanoComputing/kano-repository-manager/wiki/How-to-contribute)!

In any case, if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or problems,
please [let me know](https://twitter.com/radekpazdera), Iâ€™ll be happy to help
you :-).
