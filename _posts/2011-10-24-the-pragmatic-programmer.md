Another great piece of computer literature I found in our campus' library! I'm
talking about **The Pragmatic Programmer** by Andy Hunt and David Thomas. And
yes, it's gooood :)!

Title of the book (in it's Czech version) states: "How to become better
programmer and create high quality software." **Right?** I want that!

It's a sort-of-a compilation of advice on software development from the
practical point of view based on the experience of the authors. A lot of books
come with a load of theory which is good too, but when you're digging through
the mounds of formal methods, it's very easy to forget about the practical side
of software development.

The very first chapter of talks about **the career of** a programmer or a
software developer. The authors say to take your career choices as investments
in your future. Pragmatic programmer should invest often and into a wide range
of technologies. I don't like the investment metaphor, but I like the thought.
Computers train is moving fast and it will run you over at some point if you
don't jump in.

What I liked about this book the most is the emphasis on automation of routine
tasks through scripting and the **DRY** principle. Having good knowlege of the
environment and tools you work with is the key in any profession. But
programmers (including myself) often tend to focus on what are we doing and on
the final results rather than _how_ we do it. And frankly, every time I stop
and think what I could do better or automatically, I always find some weak
spot.

The process of programming as in actually **writing the code** should not be
overseen as trivial. You can save yourself a lot of stress by being creative in
this area. The [DRY
principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is somewhat
connected to this. If you repeat yourself, you not only work ineffectively
(you're doing stuff twice), but you also set a trap for yourself, which you
intend to step into later in the project.

Overall the book is great and I definitely can recommend it. It's something
over 200 pages or so it shouldn't take a year to read. It's also very well
written and full of jokes, which makes it fun to read!
