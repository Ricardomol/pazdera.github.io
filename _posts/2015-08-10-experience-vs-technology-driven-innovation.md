There are two ways of building new products, whether it's an open source
library, large SaaS platform, small Android app or the next iPhone. You can sit
down and think about the **experience** the product should provide and then
look for the ways of getting it, or you can **experiment** with the technology
you already have and see what interesting comes up. The approach you use will
determine the results you'll be able to get.

## Experience-driven innovation

This is the top-down approach, driven by your vision of how the end product
should look like. What problem should it solve?  You envision the perfect
product and then look for the means to implementing it. When you don't find
the tools or technology you need, you'll invest in developing them yourself.
The implementation is as successful as close you can get the final results
to your vision.

This is the natural way of working for designers and the do this most of their
time. They start with a problem and come up with what they think the solution
should look like. If the designer is good, the product is likely to make sense,
because there's a central  story driving the whole process (whether it'll make
market sense, that's different story).

This can render good things and bad. An 1-click laundry service app, a
revolutionary way to manage your photo library or perhaps a cloud platform
where you can deploy with just `git push`. If you're relying solely on this
approach, you better have some really good vision, because that is what limits
the end result. **You won't make anything you can't think of.**

In an example from the world of fiction writers, this would be writing a novel
from a **predetermined outline**. Authors such as
[Jo Nesbø](https://youtu.be/sVQKuOHUDQU) plan their books from the beginning
to the end in advance and deviate only a little from the prepared plot. But if
you're not Jo Nesbø, you might not be able to come up with such a
mind-boggling plot from the top of your head.

## Technology-driven innovation

Experimentation goes bottom up. You take things you know or have, combine them
and see what happens. This opens a whole new realm of possibilities where
serendipity works on your behalf. You can use the technology outside its usual
scope or apply uncommon procedures, do things you wouldn't normally do. There's
not really that much to it, just try stuff out and hope for the best.

This is the engineering way of doing things and surprising number of inventions
had been discovered by a lucky chance. The problem is that since it's lucky,
its pretty tricky to manage.

Google famously used to give their employees 20% of their time to do whatever
they wanted and it had worked well for them more than once with services like
Gmail, AdSense and Google Talk, rising from experimental side projects that
would hardly get past the company direction meetings at the time.

Arguably, blind experimentation can produce a lot of crap and the pearl may
remind hidden away from you for a long time. Should you find it though, the
reward is too high to be missed. A product that changes the way we think about
the industry takes always a whole lot of effort and good bit of luck.

On a less successful note, smartwatches are the latest artefact of innovation
based on existing technology. We know how to make small computers so why not
shrink them a bit more and put them on people's wrists? That sounds great, but
far as experience goes, you end up with overpriced, nagging notification
centres with screens the size of your thumb.

You probably wouldn't arrive at what smartwatches are today while focusing on
the experience. "We want to change the way people think about watches. Imagine
a bulky, three line display, instantly accessible on your hand that will show
you the first 15 characters of your email's subject, provided you have your
phone on you." Oh, wait…

Back to fiction: this would be how the famous horror author [Stephen King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King)
usually works. He starts with a specific character or scene and writes away to
discover what happens next. He lets his characters decide. But if you're
not Stephen King, your story might just end up being a really boring chain of
events.

## So which one?

It probably won't be surprising that the best approach to innovation is **a
clever combination of both**. Different companies and products may require a
different mix and the ratio can vary greatly. Early validation and user testing
are invaluable in any case. However, if you decide to stick with just one, make
sure you're at the top of the game, like Jo Nesbø or Stephen King.
