Today I'm going to write some examples of **Bridge**. The [design
pattern](http://www.oodesign.com/bridge-pattern.html) not the
[game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQRdnEtzjiQ). Bridge is a _structural
pattern_ that decouples abstraction from the implementation of some component
so the two can vary independently. The bridge pattern can also be thought of as
two layers of abstraction[3].

Bridge pattern is useful in times when you need to switch between multiple
implementations at runtime. Another great case for using bridge is when you
need to couple pool of interfaces with a pool of implementations (e.g. 5
different interfaces for different clients and 3 different implementations for
different platforms). You need to make sure, that there's a solution for every
type of client on each platform. This could lead to very large number of
classes in the inheritance hierarchy doing virtually the same thing. The
implementation of the abstraction is moved one step back and hidden behind
another interface. This allows you to outsource the implementation into another
(orthogonal) inheritance hierarchy behind another interface. The original
inheritance tree uses implementation through the bridge interface. Let's have a
look at diagram in **Figure 1**.

As you can see, there are two orthogonal inheritance hierarchies. The first
one is behind `ImplementationInterface` . This implementation is _injected_
using aggregation through `Bridge` class into the second hierarchy under the
`AbstractInterface` . This allows having multiple cases coupled with multiple
underlying implementations. The Client then uses objects through
`AbstractInterface` . Let's see it in code.

## C++

{% highlight cpp %}
/* Implemented interface. */
class AbstractInterface
{
    public:
        virtual void someFunctionality() = 0;
};

/* Interface for internal implementation that Bridge uses. */
class ImplementationInterface
{
    public:
        virtual void anotherFunctionality() = 0;
};

/* The Bridge */
class Bridge : public AbstractInterface
{
    protected:
        ImplementationInterface* implementation;

    public:
        Bridge(ImplementationInterface* backend)
        {
            implementation = backend;
        }
};

/* Different special cases of the interface. */

class UseCase1 : public Bridge
{
    public:
        UseCase1(ImplementationInterface* backend)
          : Bridge(backend)
        {}

        void someFunctionality()
        {
            std::cout << "UseCase1 on ";
            implementation->anotherFunctionality();
        }
};

class UseCase2 : public Bridge
{
    public:
        UseCase2(ImplementationInterface* backend)
          : Bridge(backend)
        {}

        void someFunctionality()
        {
            std::cout << "UseCase2 on ";
            implementation->anotherFunctionality();
        }
};

/* Different background implementations. */

class Windows : public ImplementationInterface
{
    public:
        void anotherFunctionality()
        {
            std::cout << "Windows" << std::endl;
        }
};

class Linux : public ImplementationInterface
{
    public:
        void anotherFunctionality()
        {
            std::cout << "Linux!" << std::endl;
        }
};

int main()
{
    AbstractInterface *useCase = 0;
    ImplementationInterface *osWindows = new Windows;
    ImplementationInterface *osLinux = new Linux;

    /* First case */
    useCase = new UseCase1(osWindows);
    useCase->someFunctionality();

    useCase = new UseCase1(osLinux);
    useCase->someFunctionality();

    /* Second case */
    useCase = new UseCase2(osWindows);
    useCase->someFunctionality();

    useCase = new UseCase2(osLinux);
    useCase->someFunctionality();

    return 0;
}

## Summary
The Bridge pattern is very close to the
[Adapter](http://linuxwell.wordpress.com/2011/08/15/design-patterns-adapter/
"Design Patterns:Â Adapter") by it's structure, but there's a huge difference in
semantics. Bridge is designed up-front to let the abstraction and the
implementation vary independently. Adapter is retrofitted to make unrelated
classes work together [1].
