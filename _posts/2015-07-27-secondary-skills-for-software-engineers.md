Software engineering is often a part of a much larger process.
Bringing a product to market requires user research, design, management,
marketing and many other skill sets, frequently split between different
roles or even teams. But that doesn't mean they *have to* be. This post
discusses how you can use different skills to amplify your impact as a software
developer and make your work even more valuable if you get just a bit tired of
programming.

## 1. Design

One of the more exciting and obviously useful skills for a software developer
is design. In a world of web and mobile applications, good UI/UX is absolutely
essential for your project's success. Making games is an opportunity to
exercise many design-related disciplines at once.

Early stage startups will tear your hands off while trying to recruit you if
you can build well designed websites, Android or iOS apps on your own. But you
can also be a freelancer and make them for clients or to sell them directly on
the App/Play stores. The design and development feedback loop is in your head,
letting you move fast and iterate quicker.

Whether it's visual, interaction, product or game design, there's a lot to
learn. But you can start right now, by picking up a few books, taking a
course, checking out a few videos on YouTube and start practising. Open source
projects are always on the look for designers and even if your work won't be
world class from the start, chances are it will be better than no design at all.

## 2. Hardware and electronics

With so many online services and open source projects freely available, people
aren't as keen to pay for software as they used to be. This leads companies
to seek alternative forms of revenue to support their business and one of them
is specialised hardware. Products that works closely with an app on your
computer or phone are increasingly more common and buzzwords like *Wearables*
and *internet of things* have been around for quite some time now.

Being well versed in both hardware and software engineering is a great
combination. You can build prototypes and proof-of-concept devices using just
a micro controller, bunch of resistors and C compiler, opening a whole new
dimension for innovation for yourself and whomever will require your services.

Needless to say, electronics is tough. But it's never been easier to just start
doing it. You can join hack spaces in your area to get help and participate in
open hardware projects.

## 3. Data Science

"What you don't measure, you can't manage" or "Let's make a dashboard" are
phrases no serious senior management meeting goes without. Leaving out whether
that makes any sense, companies gather awful lot of data about their users
these days. But watching their every move, click or tap, and even reading their
mind won't be to much use without making sense of the data and interpreting it
correctly. And that's where data science comes in.

Because most of the data are electronic, tucked away in dusty databases,
software engineers make great data scientists. If you enjoyed statistics at
uni, this is a great way to make use of it at work.

Being able to process huge amounts of data and distil them into insights about
the business can be immensely valuable for any company and a great set of
skills for your career. Your work could be providing basis for major
strategical decisions of the executives and having a tremendous impact on whole
corporations.

Again, there are [many excellent
resources](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/how-to-actually-learn-data-science/)
available online. The internet is also home to lots of free data sets to
practice your skills on. Just take the front pages of all major newspapers and
get some useful insights off them.

## 4. Marketing

Marketing probably wouldn't make it into the TOP3 highest regarded professions
amongst the software engineering crowd; maybe not even TOP250. And so it may
seem a bit odd to offer it here as a good secondary skill. But if you think
about it, being able to build things and spread the word about them on your own
can be an extremely valuable combo.

Selling stuff online has never been easier. Using one of the App/Play stores,
services like [Stripe](https://stripe.com) or platforms like
[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com) or [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/), let you
take money off people's hands with historically low amount of hassle.

The difficult thing is making people want to give them to you, which is
usually done by solving some of their problems. And there are lots of problems
that can be solved by writing software. It doesn't have to be big or insanely
complicated, just solve someone's problem. Check out what [Justin
Jackson](http://justinjackson.ca/about/) have been doing. He's also working
on a book called
[Marketing for Developers](http://justinjackson.ca/marketingfordevelopers/)
that should be out later this year.

Being a developer and good marketer also makes you a great fit with companies
that actually need to market to developers. Cloud service providers and
generally anyone who offers an API has use for dev evangelists and community
managers. Engineers are a merciless crowd and being one of them gives you much
higher chances of being heard.

## 5. Management and corporate

Taking part or moving entirely to management is a path many senior programmers
take in bigger companies. In larger teams, programming is as much
about people as it is about code and making sure the culture is right is
really important.

Recruiting good programmers is expensive and losing them even more so. Good
managers and team leaders are essential to achieving high employee retention.
Being a programmer yourself will help you better understand your team and
create an environment where things get done and people are happy.

Management skills are difficult to learn on your own. While there may be plenty
of resources, becoming a good manager without actually having anybody to manage
is tricky. Most people move into it gradually by sticking with one company for
long enough and being proactive in the organisation organisation.

Helping people perform well, grow in their profession and enjoy their work
is a no small feat and can be incredibly rewarding too.

## 6. None

And if programming is all you want to do all the time? That's fine too! In
fact, it's a path chosen by many. Computing is such a wide industry and there's
always more to learn. Go deep, overspecialise and become better than everyone
else in your niche. You'll be able to tackle the most difficult of problems and
solve what everybody else gets stuck on. Just pick a stack that you like and
stick with it for a while.

The size of the internet nowadays requires companies to run their services at
unprecedented scales, dealing with problems that demand the highest expertise.
With the right amount of dedication, you can be the lead solutions architect
that turns the wildest dreams into reality.

Specialised skill sets are often much more sought after by large companies than
early stage startups. The problem isn't that they wouldn't want someone that
good, it's that they can't justify the expense yet.

## The end

These were a few interesting combinations of software development with other
skills, but certainly not all of them. As I said in the beginning, software is
just a solution, a means to an end. By learning about the things that come
before or after or about the problems the software is solving, your work can
have much more impact.
