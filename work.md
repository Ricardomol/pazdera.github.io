### A developer's guide to getting into open source

My contribution to the [Beginners to open source](http://opensource.com/resources/beginners-open-source)
collection at [Opensource.com](http://opensource.com).


### tco

A Ruby library/command-line app that simplifies working with the full range of
256 colours supported by modern terminals.

Get the code at [Github](https://github.com/pazdera/tco) or the gem at
[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/tco). An
[introductory blog post](http://radek.io/2014/03/30/tco/) is available as well.
